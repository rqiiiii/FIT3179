      Malaysia’s road networks are among the busiest in Southeast Asia, connecting millions of people every day. But behind this movement lies a persistent challenge — <b>road accidents continue to claim thousands of lives each year</b>, making road safety a pressing public concern.
      This visual story explores <b>how, where, and who</b> is most affected by road accidents in Malaysia. Through global and national comparisons, we uncover key trends that shape the country’s road safety landscape.

          In contrast, <strong>Malaysia’s rate sits close to the regional average</strong>, suggesting moderate performance —
          yet still far from the safest nations globally.

        <strong>Kuala Lumpur consistently records the highest accident rates</strong>, reflecting its dense traffic and urban congestion.
        However, a noticeable dip occurred in <strong id="covidYear">2021</strong>, when lockdowns during the COVID-19 pandemic significantly
        reduced vehicle movement — offering a glimpse of what safer roads could look like.
